# Kohler-DTV-
Results of analyzing the Kohler DTV+ system controller and associated web page.

The Kohler DTV+ system controller (K-99695-NA and K-99693-P-NA) has an associated web page that is used to confogure the system components.

I spent some time looking into the web page and controller code and found a few useful pieces of information that would provie very useful if someone was inclined to interface withi this controller from another automation system.

By taking advantage of the discovered CGI scripts, someone could easily create a custom interface to manipulate the DTV+ components (Turn shower on, off, Turn on massage, Manipulate Audio or Lighting, etc).

None of this is documented by Kohler and as such such you will assume all responsibility for issues that may present themselves from interfacing with the controller in this way.

Here is a list of all CGI scripts I found that were coded into the controller. These can be executed by appending them to the end of the system controller url. For example: http://192.168.1.222/check_updates.cgi

Important: Through some initial testing I have found that some of these work and others do not. When some are executed the controller web page appears to freeze and a reboot is required. Proceed with caution. I will do some more digging and see if I can find details on whether or not any of the below cgi scripts require inputs and what those may be. Happy hacking!

Regarding the controller itself.

I have found that it is not possible to SSH into the contorller through the DHCP provided IP address. However, through analysis of the system operating system I see that they have an implementation of SSHD active on the chip. I assume that it is not enabled. There is also no active USB port. However, the board itself has pins for one. I believe Kohler has removed the USB port in the latest models.

Without a USB port and no SSH access it will be very difficult to devise another way of interfcing with the controller other than through the discovered cgi scripts.

** UPDATE **

I have found a few references to what looks to be a REST api in some of the files Iwas able to peep into.

In particular, I see a reference to "/api/v1/device/status/"

I will be spending some time looking into this to see what I can find. Stay tuned.
