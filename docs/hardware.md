# Kohler DTV+ Hardware Specification

## Overview

The Kohler DTV+ system is a digital shower controller built around a Freescale ColdFire V4 microcontroller. It communicates with peripheral devices (steam generators, rain panels, light bridges, amplifiers, valve assemblies) over RS485 buses and provides a touchscreen UI interface. This document captures the hardware architecture as determined through reverse engineering.

## Main Processor

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| CPU | Freescale MCF5441X ColdFire V4 |
| Architecture | 32-bit CISC (Motorola 68K lineage) |
| Clock Speed | ~250 MHz |
| Instruction Set | ColdFire ISA_A+ with hardware divide, MAC |
| Package | BGA |
| Core Count | 1 (single core) |

The MCF5441X integrates 8 UARTs, Ethernet MAC, FlexBus external bus, GPIO, timers, and DMA -- making it well-suited for a multi-port RS485 controller.

## Memory

| Type | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Internal SRAM | 64 KB | On-chip, zero-wait-state |
| External SRAM | 16 MB | Connected via FlexBus |
| NAND Flash | See below | HCC SafeFlash filesystem |

### NAND Flash Detail

The firmware references 512 MB NAND flash capacity, but physical inspection and repair documentation indicate a **Micron** part:

| Parameter | 16-bit Variant | 8-bit Variant |
|---|---|---|
| Part Number | MT29F2G16AABWP | MT29F2G08 |
| Chip ID | 0x2CCA | 0x2CDA |
| Capacity | 256 MB (2 Gbit) | 256 MB (2 Gbit) |
| Page Size | 2048 bytes + 64 bytes OOB | 2048 bytes + 64 bytes OOB |
| Block Size | 128 KB (64 pages per block) | 128 KB (64 pages per block) |
| Total Blocks | 2048 | 2048 |
| Bus Width | 16-bit | 8-bit |

> **Note:** The discrepancy between 512 MB (firmware references) and 256 MB (physical chip) may be due to firmware supporting multiple flash variants, or the 512 MB figure including raw capacity before ECC overhead.

## RTOS

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| RTOS | MQX 3.8 |
| Vendor | Freescale / NXP |
| Kernel Features | Preemptive multitasking, message queues, semaphores, events, lightweight timers |
| TCP/IP Stack | RTCS (Real-Time Communication Suite) |
| File System | HCC SafeFlash + SafeFAT |
| Shell | MQX Shell (debug builds) |

MQX 3.8 is tightly integrated with the MCF5441X BSP (Board Support Package), providing drivers for all on-chip peripherals.

---

## RS485 Interfaces

The controller has two distinct RS485 bus systems:

### DTV+ Ports (8 ports)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Count | 8 independent ports |
| Physical Layer | RS485 half-duplex |
| Baud Rate | 9600 |
| UART Mapping | Internal MCU UARTs 1-8 |
| Protocol | DTV+ protocol |
| Device Discovery | Auto-discovery with address assignment |
| Direction Control | GPIO-driven DE/RE pins per port |

Ports 1-8 map directly to the MCF5441X's on-chip UART peripherals. Each port has dedicated RS485 transceiver hardware with GPIO-controlled direction (transmit enable / receive enable).

### Valve Ports (2 ports)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Count | 2 independent ports |
| Physical Layer | RS485 half-duplex |
| Baud Rate | 9600 |
| UART Hardware | External TL16C752C dual UART |
| Bus Interface | FlexBus (memory-mapped I/O) |
| Base Addresses | Channel A: 0xC0000000, Channel B: 0xC0010000 |
| Protocol | Saturn protocol |

The TL16C752C is a Texas Instruments dual UART with 64-byte FIFOs, accessed as a memory-mapped peripheral through the ColdFire FlexBus interface.

## Replacement Hardware Recommendations

For building an open-source replacement controller, the following modern components are recommended:

### MCU Options

| Component | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCU | STM32H7 | i.MX RT1060 | ESP32-S3 |
| Core | Cortex-M7 @ 480MHz | Cortex-M7 @ 600MHz | Xtensa LX7 dual @ 240MHz |
| RAM | 1 MB internal | 1 MB internal | 512 KB internal |
| Flash | 2 MB internal | External (FlexSPI) | 16 MB external (typical) |
| UARTs | Up to 8 | Up to 8 | 3 (needs expansion) |
| Ethernet | Yes (some variants) | Yes (100M + optional PHY) | No (WiFi only) |
| Notes | Best balance | Highest performance | WiFi built-in, fewer UARTs |

### External UART Options

| Component | Channels | Interface | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SC16IS752 | 2 | SPI or I2C | Drop-in for TL16C752C replacement |
| MAX3107 | 1 | SPI or I2C | Single channel, very compact |

### RS485 Transceiver Options

| Component | Features | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MAX485 | Basic, half-duplex | Classic choice, needs DE/RE GPIO |
| SP485 | Basic, half-duplex | Pin-compatible with MAX485 |
| MAX13487 | Auto-direction | No DE/RE GPIO needed |
| SN65HVD75 | 3.3V, auto-direction | Low power, modern choice |

### Software Stack Replacements

| Original | Replacement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MQX RTOS | FreeRTOS | Open-source, widely supported |
| RTCS (TCP/IP) | lwIP or FreeRTOS+TCP | Open-source TCP/IP stacks |
| HCC SafeFlash | LittleFS or FatFS | Open-source flash filesystems |
| CodeWarrior | STM32CubeIDE / PlatformIO | Free IDE options |

### Minimum Specifications for Replacement

| Parameter | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | ARM Cortex-M4 @ 120 MHz | ARM Cortex-M7 @ 400+ MHz |
| RAM | 128 KB | 256 KB |
| Flash | 1 MB | 2 MB |
| UARTs | 11 total (2 valve + 8 DTV+ + 1 UI) | 11+ with DMA support |
| Ethernet | 10/100 Mbps | 10/100 Mbps with hardware MAC |
| GPIO | 12+ (RS485 DE/RE, relays, inputs) | 20+ for expansion |
| SPI/I2C | At least 1 bus for UART expanders | Multiple buses |

> **Note on UART count:** 11 UARTs is a hard requirement. Most MCUs top out at 6-8, so external UART expanders (SC16IS752 or similar) are typically needed for the valve ports or some DTV+ ports.
